# Front End Coding Exercise

For this exercise, you will be developing (from scratch) a JavaScript based simulation of a farm.

On this farm, there should be several types of animals. These animals will wander around and get hungry over time. You will feed them to reset their state. You should be able to tell visually that an animal is hungry.

In the example mockup the yellow animals are not hungry, but the blue ones are hungry. 

Without using any frameworks or helper libraries, please build this farm with the following in mind:

- Use HTML Canvas to render the farm. 
- The animals should each be instances of an animal type (e.g. Cow, Chicken), derived from a base Animal type.
- The animals should get hungry over time, represented by a change in colour.
- You should be able to reset the animal's hunger by clicking on it to feed it.
- The animals should wander around the farm.
 
Structure, format, and comments in your code are important for communicating your approach to the problem.

Show us what you can do.
